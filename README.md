# Final Project II: Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases in China: Past, Present, and Future

## Research Questions

1. Which province in China has the most COVID-19 deaths? What's the best way to visually represent the information?
2. Which province in China has the most impressive COVID-19 recovery rate? Is there any reason for such a bounce back?
3. How do COVID-19 cases evolve over time in different China provinces? What should policymakers do to address such issue?
4. Can policymakers predict the number of COVID-19 deaths (t+1) in Hubei based on the historical data CSSE collected?
